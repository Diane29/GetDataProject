### Overview

The purpose of the project is to access data from an external source then clean it up to produce a tidy dataset. 
This data was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository then unzipped and stored in a folder on my local directory.
A R-script (Run_Analysis.R) was created to modify the data (see CodeBook.md).
The final dataset resulting from the R-script has been written to the text file tidy_data.txt.
